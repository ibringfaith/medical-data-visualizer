# Medical Data Visualizer

This is the boilerplate for the Medical Data Visualizer project. Instructions for building the project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer

In this project, I visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.
